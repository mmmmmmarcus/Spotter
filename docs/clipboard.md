# Clipboard history

Clipboard is a self-contained native plugin under `Spotter/Plugins/Clipboard/`. The directory owns
`ClipboardPlugin`, `ClipboardManager`, `ClipboardStore`, the palette view and its Settings view;
`AppCore` remains the sole owner of the long-lived manager and store instances.

## Poll-based capture

`ClipboardManager` runs a 0.5s `Timer` watching `NSPasteboard.general.changeCount`. To avoid
re-capturing Spotter's own writes, every write stamps a private `internalType` marker on the
pasteboard and the poller skips anything carrying it.

Its plugin lifecycle starts this timer only while the plugin is enabled;
disabling it stops capture without deleting existing history, and re-enabling resumes with the
current pasteboard change count so old contents are not re-captured.

## Store

`Spotter/Plugins/Clipboard/ClipboardStore.swift` is SQLite-backed: rows plus a trigram FTS5 index in
`clipboard.sqlite3`, with image blobs as loose PNG files, all under
`~/Library/Caches/<bundle-id>/`. The newest 1000 rows are mirrored in the `@Published items` window;
FTS search reaches older rows.

A database that won't open is deleted and recreated (worst case the store degrades to session-only
in-memory history).

Image capture (TIFF→PNG re-encode + blob write) runs off the main actor via detached tasks; row
inserts, search, and pruning stay on the main actor.

## Pinned entries

A row's ⌘K Actions menu carries **Pin Entry / Unpin Entry** (⌘P), persisted as a `pinned_at` column
on `items` (added to existing databases by an `ALTER TABLE` migration, alongside `source_app`'s) —
a stamp rather than a flag, because the Pinned section is ordered by *when you pinned*, not by
recency.

Pins change four things:

- **Order.** `search` returns pinned rows first — for the empty query and for FTS hits alike — under
  one "Pinned" section above the date buckets, in pin order with the oldest pin at the top, so a new
  pin joins the end of the section instead of displacing the ones already there. `items` itself stays
  in pure recency order; the display split is memoized next to the search memo and invalidated with
  it. Pinned rows are matched **in memory**
  rather than taken from the FTS result, since the statement's `LIMIT` could otherwise drop one out
  of a busy query's matches — which holds because every pinned row is resident in `items`, however
  old (`load` fetches them all, and neither the window trim nor pruning drops one).
- **Unpinning re-recencies.** An unpinned row rejoins the history as its *newest* entry (Raycast does
  the same) rather than dropping back into the date bucket it came from, which would scroll the list
  out from under the selection. It's the same delete + re-insert `promote` uses.
- **Retention.** Pruning skips pinned rows (`AND pinned_at IS NULL`), so a pin outlives the retention
  window. "Clear History" still deletes everything.
- **Selection.** Pinning lifts a row out of its date bucket, so `AppCore.togglePinnedClip` moves the
  palette selection to the row's new index in the *current* results and bumps `palette.followToken`,
  which is what makes the list scroll the highlight back into view.

Pasting a pinned entry deliberately does **not** promote it: it holds its place in the Pinned
section, so `promote` skips pinned rows instead of rewriting the row and its FTS entry for no
visible change.

Deleting one entry, deleting all entries, and the ⌘Delete shortcut all pass through the shared
in-palette confirmation card. Cancel owns the initial Return highlight, and clearing history names
that pinned entries are included.

`load` reads every pinned row plus the newest 1000 unpinned ones as two indexed branches over a
partial index on `pinned_at` (`Tools/clipboard-test.swift` covers the shape). The single
`pinned_at IS NOT NULL OR rowid >= ?` form reads better but cannot be driven from an index while
holding row order, so it scans the whole table — ~12ms against ~1ms at 200k rows, on the main actor
at launch.
