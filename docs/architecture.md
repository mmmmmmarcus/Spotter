# Architecture

How Spotter is wired together. See the per-subsystem docs for internals:
[palette](palette.md), [launcher](launcher.md), [calculator](calculator.md),
[clipboard](clipboard.md), [custom commands](custom-commands.md), [hotkeys](hotkeys.md), [ui](ui.md).

## Single-owner core

`AppCore.shared` (`Core/AppCore.swift`) is a `@MainActor` singleton that owns every long-lived
manager — `AppIndex`, `ClipboardStore`, `ClipboardManager`, `HotKeyManager`, `AppSettings`,
`FavoritesStore`, `VisibilityStore`, `LauncherRankingStore`, `CustomCommandStore`,
`CalculatorHistoryStore`,
`CurrencyRateStore`, `RunningAppsMonitor`, `PaletteViewModel` — plus the window controllers.
`AppDelegate.applicationDidFinishLaunching` calls
`AppCore.shared.start()` and nothing else; that is the single wiring point. All palette / paste /
launch actions are methods on `AppCore` that the SwiftUI views call.

## Entry points and windows

`SpotterApp` (`@main`) declares only a `MenuBarExtra` scene; everything else visible is driven
imperatively from AppKit.

- **Command palette** — a borderless floating `NSPanel` (`Core/PalettePanel.swift`) hosting SwiftUI
  via `NSHostingView`, managed by `PaletteWindowController`. It toggles between a compact bar and the
  full launcher by resizing the window. `PaletteWindowController` solely owns the frame (resolved once
  per show to a top-left anchor so it grows downward), and the hosting view sets `sizingOptions = []`
  so SwiftUI never drives the window size — without that the hosting view resizes the panel to fit
  content and the top edge drifts on the compact↔expanded swap. The panel auto-dismisses on
  `windowDidResignKey`.
- **Settings / About** — plain `NSWindow`s via `AuxWindowController` (in
  `Features/About/AboutView.swift`). SwiftUI `Settings` / `Window` scenes are unreliable for accessory
  apps, so this is deliberate.

The app forces `.darkAqua` appearance globally; the Liquid Glass material is tuned for a dark surface
only.

## Concurrency

The target builds in **Swift 6 language mode** (tools version 6.0, no language-mode override), so
data-race safety violations are hard errors. Almost everything is `@MainActor`; cross-actor model
types are `Sendable`. Heavy / IO work (app scan, image decode, the FX rate fetch) is deliberately
pushed off-main via `Task.detached` / `nonisolated`. Keep that boundary when adding code.

House idioms for the sharp edges:

- Block-observer lifetimes go through the RAII `NotificationToken` (`Core/NotificationToken.swift`)
  instead of removal in a `deinit`.
- `ClipboardStore` uses `isolated deinit` for its SQLite teardown.
- Raw Carbon / C pointers get decoded to plain values before crossing into actor code (see
  `hotKeyCarbonEventHandler`).
